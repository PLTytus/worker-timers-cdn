# worker-timers-cdn

This repository was create to use [worker-timers](https://github.com/chrisguttandin/worker-timers) module not as a module but as a regular script. Meaning, no webpack, rollup, grunt, and whatever else is out there - at least at your end.

Whay you need to make this work? Simply download [WorkerTimers.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PLTytus/worker-timers-cdn/master/WorkerTimers.js) and add it to your project. You can even skip the downloading part (not recommended) and use URL to the rwa file in this repostiory.
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="WorkerTimers.js"></script>
